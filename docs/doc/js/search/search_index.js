Website\n\n\n\nCurrently the page ist hosted on GitHub. \nIt will be soon available on a Web Server with an domain.\nDocumentation for this app is found here\nHosting\nHosting of the code powered by GitLab and for pages on GitHub\nBuild / Patch\nRunning yarn version --new-version patch / minor / major will create the semver version in the package.json and the tag in git\nExecute yarn build for a normal build into dist folder.\nPerforming yarn build:docs will create a new version for GitHub Pages in the docs folder.\nDevelopment\nAs a developer you need following tools are necessary to develop this project:\n\nNode.JS LTS v8.11.1\npreferred installing Node.JS via nvm for more details see nvm for unix/osx or nvm for windows\nYarn v1.7.0\nAngular CLI v6.1.0\nGit\n\nInstall all required dependencies with yarn install\n\nCopy src/environments/environment.example.ts to environment.ts\nFill out needed informations in the environment.ts file\nRunning yarn start wil start up development server on http://localhost:4200\n\nHint: If you want to access the project on a mobile device in your network run ng serve --host=0.0.0.0\nDocumentation\nThe Documentation is powered by compodoc! \nJust hit yarn generate:documentation and it will create the folder based on Code, Comments etc.\nIt will also show the documentation level (currently low, will be up in some time). \nUnit Test Coverage will follow as well.\nChangelog\nA Changelog is provided in the project root under the filename CHANGELOG.md\nCI / CD\nContinous Integration will be available over GitLab Jobs. \nCurrently the automatic build is configured via gitlab-ci.yml.\nFirst we use a pre configured karma docker image. Then install yarn, and the dependencies of the Project.\nIf that is done sucessfully, the unit & e2e will run. \nFinally it builds all necessary files into docs/ folder and delivers it as artifcats.\nGitLab will store the artifacts for 14 days.\nFirebase\nAs database is Firebase from Google used. The credentials for it are stored in the environment.prod.env\nMore Informations follows soon, the code will be updated, in order to make the blog work.\nAuthentication\nWill be available through firebase.\nLogin Function currently works if you press anywhere on the webpage l.\nAngular CLI\nThis project was generated with Angular CLI version 6.0.8. And updated to 6.1.0.\nRunning ng -v in the Project root after having installed Angular CLI will print out both the installed global and local package version.\nRunning ng update in the Project root will show any available Updates for angular\nDevelopment server\nRun ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.\nCode scaffolding\nRun ng generate component component-name to generate a new component. You can also use ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module.\nBuild\nRun ng build to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the docs/ directory. Use the --prod flag for a production build.\nRunning unit tests\nRun ng test to execute the unit tests via Karma.\nRunning end-to-end tests\nRun ng e2e to execute the end-to-end tests via Protractor.\nFurther help\nTo get more help on the Angular CLI use ng help or go check out the Angular CLI README.\nAbout the developer\nStuttgart-Based developer running a dj/producer project.
