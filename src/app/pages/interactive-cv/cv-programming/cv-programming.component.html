<p>
  There is a use case for any language!<br>
  I learned a lot of different languages, that is one reason for it!<br>
  Splitting applications in order to create microservices, has a lot of positive aspects!<br>
  I try always to achieve a MultiOS Level for my apps!<br>
  For a best solution, the toolkit must be big! I'm always open for new things!
